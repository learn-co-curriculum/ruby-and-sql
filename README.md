# ruby-and-sql

The end goal is for students to understand all of the stuff around doing this (https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/pokemon-scraper/blob/solution/bin/run.rb) and this (https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/pokemon-scraper/blob/solution/bin/sql_runner.rb)

 - Start with explaining that we've done a lot with SQL but we need to actually bring it into ruby
 - Compare to the command line commands. So things like when I type sqlite3 <DBNAME> that's the same as SQLite3::Database.new('<DBNAME')
